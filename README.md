S&amp;DS 230 Final Project: Sleep Amongst Healthcare Workers During the Pandemic

The Covid-19 pandemic has undoubtedly had a large toll on people across the world, but one of the groups impacted the most is healthcare workers. The pandemic has brought stress about hospital room shortages, supply shortages, and personnel shortages, and health care workers bear the brunt of all this responsibility. In this project, our group aimed to analyze the best predictors for the amount of sleep workers got in April 2020, right after the pandemic hit America extremely hard and the entire nation went into lock down. With stories of health care workers working 48 hour or longer shifts, our group wanted to see what factors could lead to health care workers receiving differing amounts of sleep during the pandemic. Sleep is connected to the physical well-being of humans, so our group assumed that loss of sleep would mean that health care workers' physical health was impacted (lack of sleep can lead to fatigue, muscle pain, etc.). This model can be useful in predicting which groups of healthcare workers will be hit the hardest (and lose the most sleep) if the pandemic were to rebound, as well as allow health care workers to look back upon their lack of sleep during the early stages of the pandemic and find out what factors led their physical health to deteriorate.
